    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda">
        Bermuda is named after Spanish explorer Juan de Berm√∫dez, who discovered the archipelago in 1505. The islands have been
        permanently inhabited since 1612, when an English settlement was established at St. George's. Forming part of British
        America, Bermuda was governed under royal charter by the Somers Isles Company until 1684, when it became a crown colony.
        The first African slaves were taken to Bermuda in 1616, but a full plantation economy did not develop and the slave
        trade largely ceased by the end of the 17th century. The economy instead became maritime-focused, with the colony
        serving as a base for merchants, privateers and the Royal Navy, and giving its name to the Bermuda rig and Bermuda
        sloop. Tourism has been a significant contributor to Bermuda's economy since the 19th century, and after World War II
        the territory became a prominent offshore financial centre and tax haven.
